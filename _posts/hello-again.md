Hello reader ðŸ™‚Â If youâ€™re new here, welcome ðŸ‘‹ - if youâ€™ve been here before, thank you for coming back!

Itâ€™s been 3 years since my last post, mostly because life/career/a whole pandemic got in the way. 

Since I last wrote I have..

- Moved to a new company! I started working for The Student Room Group in September 2019, to begin with in my first mid-level role as a Frontend Engineer on a product called Enlitened.
- Over the summer of 2020 the pandemic forced us to pack up Enlitened and I moved onto the core The Student Room team. I spent a year working on The UniGuide product, which is a mostly Ruby on Rails based application, and started to integrate a React frontend onto the site. I also led a project to improve the Core Web Vitals of the site, taking the site from having 100% â€˜poorâ€™ rated URLs by Google on the site to 99.6% â€˜goodâ€™ or â€˜needs improvementâ€™.
- In July 2021 I started working on the core The Student Room product, a forum site/community for students to chat about anything and everything. Iâ€™ve been leading on the frontend architecture front to rebuild the thread pages on the forum site in React - which weâ€™ve just launched!
- Iâ€™ve grown so much as a developer over the last 3 years, from coming in as an entry-level mid-level developer, to being promoted to Senior Frontend Developer, and more recently moving into an Engineering Team Lead role.

So why have I resurrected my blog? Well since iâ€™ve been rearchitecting our product in React, iâ€™ve been wanting to dabble in new JS technologies and it felt like a good time to rebuild my site. Any developer will tell you that they get fed up of the look of their site around once a year and feel the urge to completely overhaul it ðŸ˜‚Â so Iâ€™ve rebuilt my site in NextJS, and totally simplified it down to just being somewhere I can jot down my thoughts about tech or concepts iâ€™m working on. It was trying to do too much before, and people can reach out to me on LinkedIn if they have any questions.

Furthermore, I was a junior developer when I last wrote on here. Iâ€™ve learned ******so much****** in that time that I want to document for myself to see how far iâ€™ve come, but also for others to pick up to help them with something theyâ€™re working on perhaps. One thing iâ€™ve come to realise since taking on a mentorship role as a Team Lead is the importance of documentation, and being able to explain complex concepts in an easy to digest way, and thatâ€™s what iâ€™m hoping to bring with the posts coming up

Themes that iâ€™m thinking.. 

- Core frontend development concepts
- ReactJS concepts
    - Accessibility
    - Structuring a react app
    - Using APIs in react apps
    - React context
    - Testing React apps

Any burning questions feel free to reach out on LinkedIn and I can perhaps write a post for it in the future!
