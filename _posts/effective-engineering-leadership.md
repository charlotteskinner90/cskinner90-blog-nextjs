Becoming a Team Lead in engineering might seem straightforward at first. But once you’re in the role, you quickly realise it’s about much more than writing good code. You’re responsible for guiding people, balancing priorities, keeping delivery on track, and making sure the team feels supported.

It’s a role that demands both technical ability and a good understanding of people. Done well, it can be one of the most rewarding parts of your career.

Here are a few things I’ve found really matter when it comes to leading well, drawn from real experience, with real teams.

## Set goals that actually help people focus

It’s surprisingly easy for a team to lose sight of the bigger picture, especially when there’s pressure to ship. Clear goals help avoid that.

Good goals give people direction and purpose. They should be easy to understand, realistic, and motivating. They should also connect to something larger than just the next feature or bug fix. If the team understands what success looks like and why it matters, they’ll stay more engaged and they’ll usually spot better ways of getting there too.

## Make communication a two-way thing

Strong teams are built on trust, and trust comes from open, honest communication.

That doesn’t mean constant meetings or over-explaining. It means making sure people know what’s going on, feel comfortable asking questions, and aren’t left guessing. When changes happen, explain the why behind them. When problems come up, talk about them early.

It also means listening. Regular check-ins, informal conversations and genuinely taking on feedback all help build a team that talks and solves things together.

## Get to know your team properly

Beyond roles and titles, every engineer brings something different. Understanding those differences is what helps you lead well.

Take the time to learn what motivates your team. What kind of work they enjoy. Where they want to grow. This helps you delegate better, support them more effectively and shape a team culture where people feel valued and seen.

You don’t need a formal plan for this. Just curiosity and a bit of time.

## Set the tone by how you show up

You don’t need to be the loudest voice in the room or have all the answers. But your attitude sets the tone.

Turn up prepared. Own your work. Admit when you’re wrong. And when something needs fixing, be the person who rolls up their sleeves and gets involved. Leadership is often about the small things: consistency, accountability and staying calm under pressure.

People notice how you handle the hard bits. That’s when trust is built.

## Celebrate the small wins, not just the big ones

In busy teams, it’s easy to move straight onto the next thing. But if you never stop to recognise progress, motivation starts to slip.

You don’t need big announcements. Sometimes a quick “great work on that release” or a shout-out in the stand-up is enough. But those moments matter. They remind people that their effort is seen and appreciated.

It builds energy, and a healthier culture.

## Final thoughts

There’s no single formula for being a great Engineering Team Lead. Every team is different. But if you focus on being clear, supportive and consistent, you’ll create an environment where people can do their best work.

Lead like someone people trust and enjoy working with. That’s where it all starts.
