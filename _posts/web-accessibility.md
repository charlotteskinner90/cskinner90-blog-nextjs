Accessibility can feel a bit intimidating at first, right? All those guidelines and legal bits. But honestly, it boils down to one thing: making sure your website doesn’t leave anyone out. Especially in the UK, where the Equality Act 2010 means you actually have to do this.

As a frontend dev, I’ve learnt that accessibility isn’t just about ticking boxes—it’s about building something that works for real people. Here’s how I keep it simple and practical.

## Use real HTML, the way it’s meant to be

Stick to proper HTML tags. Things like `<header>`, `<main>`, and sensible headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) make a big difference. Screen readers use these to get the page layout, and it just keeps your code neat too.

If you skip heading levels or use tags wrong, it can confuse people. Trust me, I’ve seen it cause real headaches.

## Write alt text like you’re describing the image to a friend

Alt text should say why the image is there. Don’t just write "image" or "photo." Instead, try something like:

`<img alt="Our team working in the office on laptops">`

That way, people who can’t see the image still get what it’s about. If an image is purely decorative though, make sure you mark it with an empty alt text. This way a screen reader will hop over it, but make sure you include one if it contains useful information!

## Make your links make sense

"Click here" doesn’t cut it anymore. Your links need to tell users where they’ll land if they follow them. So instead of:

`<a href="/about">Click here</a>`

Try:

`<a href="/about">Find out more about us</a>`

It helps screen reader users and boosts your SEO.

## Check your colours are easy to read

If your text blends into the background, it’s a pain for people with vision issues. I always use free tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker, or the Wave browser extension to make sure my colours pass the minimum contrast.

It’s a quick fix that goes a long way.

## Make sure your site works without a mouse

A surprising number of people don’t use a mouse, they rely on keyboards or other assistive tech. You need to make sure they can tab through your site and get to everything.

Try it yourself: just use your keyboard to move around the page. If you get stuck, fix it.

## Use ARIA roles When you really need them

ARIA can help screen readers understand your page, but don’t overuse it. Usually, native HTML elements are enough.

## Why accessibility is a big deal in the UK

It’s not just good manners, it’s the law. The Equality Act 2010 expects organisations to make reasonable adjustments for disabled users, including online.

Follow the minimum of WCAG 2.1 (AA) guidelines, and you’re on the right track.

## Bonus! Accessibility helps your SEO too

Good accessibility isn’t just for people, it helps Google figure out your site better which means better rankings. Semantic HTML, alt text, clear links, they all make your content easier to find.

## Wrapping up

Accessibility isn’t a "nice to have", it’s part of good development. It takes some effort, but it’s worth it.

If you’re hiring developers, someone who cares about this stuff is worth their weight in gold.
