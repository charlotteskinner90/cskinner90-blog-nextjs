Accessibility can feel a bit intimidating at first, right? All those guidelines and legal bits. But honestly, it boils down to one thing: making sure your website doesnâ€™t leave anyone out. Especially in the UK, where the Equality Act 2010 means you actually have to do this.

As a frontend dev, Iâ€™ve learnt that accessibility isnâ€™t just about ticking boxesâ€”itâ€™s about building something that works for real people. Hereâ€™s how I keep it simple and practical.

## Use real HTML, the way itâ€™s meant to be

Stick to proper HTML tags. Things like `<header>`, `<main>`, and sensible headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) make a big difference. Screen readers use these to get the page layout, and it just keeps your code neat too.

If you skip heading levels or use tags wrong, it can confuse people. Trust me, Iâ€™ve seen it cause real headaches.

## Write alt text like youâ€™re describing the image to a friend

Alt text should say why the image is there. Donâ€™t just write "image" or "photo." Instead, try something like:

`<img alt="Our team working in the office on laptops">`

That way, people who canâ€™t see the image still get what itâ€™s about. If an image is purely decorative though, make sure you mark it with an empty alt text. This way a screen reader will hop over it, but make sure you include one if it contains useful information!

## Make your links make sense

"Click here" doesnâ€™t cut it anymore. Your links need to tell users where theyâ€™ll land if they follow them. So instead of:

`<a href="/about">Click here</a>`

Try:

`<a href="/about">Find out more about us</a>`

It helps screen reader users and boosts your SEO.

## Check your colours are easy to read

If your text blends into the background, itâ€™s a pain for people with vision issues. I always use free tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker, or the Wave browser extension to make sure my colours pass the minimum contrast.

Itâ€™s a quick fix that goes a long way.

## Make sure your site works without a mouse

A surprising number of people donâ€™t use a mouse, they rely on keyboards or other assistive tech. You need to make sure they can tab through your site and get to everything.

Try it yourself: just use your keyboard to move around the page. If you get stuck, fix it.

## Make sure your tap areas are large enough ðŸ‘†
One often overlooked piece of accessibility is making sure links, buttons, and interactive elements have an appropriate tap area, especially for mobile and touch devices.

Why it matters:
Small tap areas frustrate users and can cause accessibility issues for people with motor or vision impairments. According to accessibility guidelines, tap areas should be roughly 48 x 48px (around 44 - 48Â dp), regardless of the visual size of the element.

What if you donâ€™t want to make the button itself larger?
Thatâ€™s okay, you can increase the invisible tap area:

âœ… Add padding or negative margins: Maintains a sleek design, but gives the element a larger interactive area.

âœ… Wrap icon links: Put smaller icons or links inside a parent element that has a larger hit area.

âœ… Use pseudo-elements (`::before`/`::after`): Subtly expand the click area beyond the visible boundaries.

âœ… Test in practice: Try using your site on mobile and with a keyboard. Make sure tap areas are easy to hit.

By making tap areas larger, you support accessibility guidelines while preserving a clean layout, making your site more inclusive for everyone.

## Use ARIA roles When you really need them

ARIA can help screen readers understand your page, but donâ€™t overuse it. Usually, native HTML elements are enough.

## Why accessibility is a big deal in the UK

Itâ€™s not just good manners, itâ€™s the law. The Equality Act 2010 expects organisations to make reasonable adjustments for disabled users, including online.

Follow the minimum of WCAG 2.1 (AA) guidelines, and youâ€™re on the right track.

## Bonus! Accessibility helps your SEO too

Good accessibility isnâ€™t just for people, it helps Google figure out your site better which means better rankings. Semantic HTML, alt text, clear links, they all make your content easier to find.

## Wrapping up

Accessibility isnâ€™t a "nice to have", itâ€™s part of good development. It takes some effort, but itâ€™s worth it.

If youâ€™re hiring developers, someone who cares about this stuff is worth their weight in gold.
